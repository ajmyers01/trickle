# trickle

What is the point? 
  * Create an app that allows for you to create good habits by
    clearly stating small things that will hopefully trickle into
    making you a better person.

This app was inspired by this [blog post.](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-trickle-list/)

# Todo list

* add ability to add tasks to list
* add checkbox to click when task has been completed that day.
* add 24/hr time constraints for completion of tasks 
* add graphs / stats
* add user capabilities.
* suggest new trickles based on other users with similiar trickles
